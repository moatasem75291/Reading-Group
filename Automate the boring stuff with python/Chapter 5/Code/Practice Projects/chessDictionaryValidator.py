"""
Write a function named isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary
argument and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.
A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king.
Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces
must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space'9z'.
The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black, followed by
'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'.
This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.

Example:
The following dictionary would pass because it has one black king and one white king.
{'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen',
'3e': 'wking'}
But this dictionary would fail because it has two white queens:
{'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen',
'3e': 'wqueen'}
