"""
You can also include ranges of letters or numbers by using a hyphen.
For example, the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase letters,
uppercase letters, and numbers.

By placing a caret character (^) just after the character classâ€™s opening bracket,
you can make a negative character class.

A negative character class will match allthe characters that are not in the character class.
