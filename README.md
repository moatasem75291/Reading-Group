# 📚 My journey with books

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey of reading books related to machine learning, deep learning, data structures, and other topics in the field. This repository serves as a platform for me to upload my work, including exercises, notes, and any other related materials as I progress through my studies.

## 📖 Books

Here's a list of the books I've been reading and studying:

1. **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron.
2. **"Data Structures and Algorithms in Python"** by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.
3. **"Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn"** by Sebastian Raschka, Yuxi (Hayden) Liu, and Vahid Mirjalili

## 📝 Notes

In this section, I keep my notes, summaries, and key takeaways from each chapter of the books I read.


## 📚 Exercises

This section contains solutions to the exercises provided at the end of each chapter in the books I'm studying. I find solving these exercises to be an essential part of my learning process, and I'm happy to share my solutions with you.
